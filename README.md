**KDDCup 2020 - Track 2 - Adversarial Attacks and Defense on Academic Graph**

https://www.biendata.xyz/competition/kddcup_2020_formal/

The challenge: Creating an **attacker** (i.e., a modified input consisting of graph structure (adjacency matrix) and node features (embedding vectors)) and a **defender** (i.e., a robust Graph Neural Network model). 
The organizers will match all attackers and defenders from all teams and rank the final leaderboard.
